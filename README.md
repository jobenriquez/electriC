## How to clone

### VSC:
1. It is a good practice to start a virtual environment before downloading a python file, this resolves most
of the compatibility issues you are facing when installing packages directly to python.

```python
python -m venv [name of your venv]
```

2. Clone the repository inside your virtual environment and paste its content outside of the 'electriC' folder.

3. Download all necessary packages including pandas and openpyxl.

### Running the Program:

1. On your terminal, run this command to open the sample file.
```python
python shell.py test.ec
```

3. Open the excel file to check what tokens were generated from the test.
