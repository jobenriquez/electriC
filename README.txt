How to clone

VSC:
1. It is a good practice to start a virtual environment before downloading a python file, this resolves most
of the compatibility issues you are facing when installing packages directly to python.

```python -m venv [name of your venv]```

2. Clone the repository inside your virtual environment and paste its content outside of the 'electriC' folder.

3. Download all necessary packages including pandas and openpyxl.

Running the Program:

1. On your terminal, run the code ```python shell.py test.ec``` to run the sample file.
2. Open the excel file to check what tokens were generated from the test.
